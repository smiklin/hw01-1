Deviant aggressive behavior
---------------------------

Consider four well-known and widely believed theories of socially deviant aggressive behavior (e.g. criminal behavior, revolutionary behavior, rude behavior):

*Theory I:* Deviant aggressive behavior is learned from experience. Individuals in a society learn to do those things for which they receive rewards and to avoid those things for which they receive punishment.

*Theory II:* Deviant aggressive behavior is a symbolic expression of hostility toward personal authority figures. When an individual is frustrated in his personal life, he becomes angry toward parents, bosses, or public officials. He will express this anger by deviant aggressive behavior.

*Theory III:* Deviant aggressive behavior is the rational action of oppressed individuals. Social rules systematically discriminate among people. People who are most hurt by the rules are least likely to profit from conforming to them and thus do conform less.

*Theory IV:* Deviant aggressive behavior is a social role. Individuals are socialized into the role through contact with a deviant subculture.

Answer the following questions:

**1) What social policy would be appropriate to reduce deviant aggressive behavior if Theory I were correct? Theory II? Theory III? Theory IV?**

If **Theory I** were correct, following the behaviorist principles the most appropriate policy would be to punish deviant aggressive behaviors, and reward alternative behaviors. In many ways, this seems to be the primary approach of our system, with the caveat that only the deviant aggressive behavior is explicitly punished, while alternative behaviors are only implicitly rewarded by avoided punishment. The reward is more easily implemented on a micro-scale through social relationships etc. Looking at it from a different perspective, however, one could also think about how violent behavior is currently being rewarded, and institute policies that would counter that process. This might take form of and educational policy: for example, changing norms about masculinity within a machismo culture might decrease the reward (greater perceived masculinity) of violent behavior.

If **Theory II** were correct, the two ways to decrease unwanted behavior would be to either 1) decrease the individual’s anger, and/or 2) establish and encourage alternative expressions of anger. To do this, an educational policy would be the most appropriate, including programs that teach conflict resolution, mindfulness and similar psycho-social skills, while providing individuals with alternative outlets such as the arts. This might also include more targeted interventions through secondary or tertiary prevention, such as anger management, mandated therapy etc. for individuals in particular risk groups or who have a history of aggressive behavior.

If **Theory III** were correct, deviant aggressive behavior would ultimately perceive itself as justified, if not necessary for the betterment of the lives of the oppressed individuals. The most appropriate policy would therefore be the policy that addresses the systemic injustice and discrimination as the root causes of the behavior. This would include policies addressing sexism, racism, poverty etc.

If **Theory IV** were correct, and the origin of the unwanted behavior was in the deviant subcultures, the most appropriate policy would aim to 1) dissolve the existing subcultures perpetuating the aggressive behavior and 2) prevent new deviant subcultures from forming. An example of this would be the attempts to address gang presence in an area, or to ban single-sex (focusing on male only) social spaces on college campuses which have been found to perpetuate sexual and other violence.

**2) During the past ten years, American society has been running a series of “experiments” with deviant aggressive behavior. Take any one of these experiments (e.g. \#MeToo, mass shootings, political rhetoric) and discuss what we have learned about the four theories from this series of experiments.**

I really struggled with this question because of the complexity of factors and lack of reliable data involved—it is quote unclear what the outcomes are or how to evaluate them. (I may be over-thinking this, but suicide research is struggling with the same issues and that is what my PhD is on...)

For example, one could argue that \#MeToo is working to punish the individuals who have committed sexual assaults (e.g. through public shaming and, in some cases, job loss), in alignment with Theory I. This might also serve to change norms of acceptable behavior and—if we can call ‘men’ a deviant subculture—address the fact that many men are socializing into thinking sexual assault is acceptable behavior (Theory IV). There isn’t much of an argument to be made regarding Theory II (\#MeToo would not address misogyny) and apart from the incel crowd, it is doubtful anyone would try to argue men are oppressed. However, beyond this hypothetical thinking, it is very difficult to tell what—if anything—\#MeToo has accomplished and if it has made an impact on incidence of sexual assault. If it has, this would provide support for Theory I, but I am not aware of any data that would show this.

The easiest way for me to think about this then was to take the actual outcomes first. For example, we know that while the national violent crime rates have been going down since the peak in the early 90s ( [source](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45236.pdf%5D)), the rates seem to have actually increased over the past few years: either due to increasing rate of violent behavior, or increase in reporting in the violent behavior. If the rates have indeed been increasing, that would prompt us to as what ‘experiment’ might’ve occurred in the past years to cause this.

One thing that comes to mind is the Great Recession, so we could think of it as a sort of an experiment. However, I can see it operating in a way that could provide support for all four theories: If resources are scarce, deviant aggressive behavior could be more rewarding (Theory I), loss of jobs or future prospects cold increase tension between individuals and authority figures (Theory II), decreased social mobility and income would expand the oppressed class, disproportionately affecting those already disadvantaged (Theory III), and lack of legal job prospects could channel more people into alternative economies where they might get socialized into increasingly aggressive behavior (Theory IV).

The [CRS report](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45236.pdf%5D), mentions another occurrence that might be taken as an ‘experiment’ in its discussion of the “Ferguson effect,” which I found quite interesting. Apparently, some data shows an increase in crime rates after high-profile incidents such as the shooting of Michael Brown. It is theorized that this is due to either (1) “de-policing” (because of police concerns over negative publicity and protests) or (2) change in perception of justice and police, which would make some individuals more likely to challenge law enforcement, while it would make others less likely to turn to law enforcement in case of a crime. Both of these pathways would support Theory I.

Waiting until the last minute
-----------------------------

> People often do things at the last minute (students turning in papers, professors grading exams, and so on).

**a) Ask yourself why the observation might be true and write down your explanations.**

I can think of many reasons why people often do things at the last minute, different combinations of which might apply depending on the circumstance. For example, some people might be very busy and are doing everything ‘at the last minute’ because any time they have before, they are using to work on something with an earlier due date. Additionally, people often do not want to do certain tasks (because they are not enjoyable, are anxiety provoking etc.) and will postpone doing them unless they really have to do them (e.g. anxiety about failing to meet the deadline becomes greater than the anxiety induced by the idea of undertaking the task). Some people might also be more productive when on a tight deadline, that is they will spend less time on a task if they have less time, overall, leaving them with more time to do other, maybe more enjoyable things—leaving things until the last minute might therefore be a learned behavior as well, as it is reinforced by (perceived) greater productivity.

**b) Generalize the explanatory model – that is, induce the most general, abstract model you can produce that still has the original observation as a consequence.**

The first model that comes to mind is one that would model this on the level of the task, that is think about whether a task will be done at the last minute.

Two approaches came to mind here.One was to model the time when one starts the task (relative to the deadline), the other is the probability of ‘doing a task last minute’. The first one is more objective, as ‘doing a task last minute’ is a somewhat subjective evaluation. However, if modeling ‘available time to do a task’, ‘estimated length’ of the task also has to be taken into account, which can also be subjective and might ultimately also depend on the time available to do the task (Starting a long paper few days before the deadline might be 'last minute', but one might also finish if faster given less time). Therefore, I choose to model the probability a person will do something last minute (as vague as this might be), as it seems simpler, and I think it is easier to generalize to a greater variety of tasks.

The model would then seek the probability that the task is 'Done last minute' vs the probability that it is no ('Done Early'), with the relevant predictors as follows
- perception of how enjoyable/anxiety inducing doing the task will be (less enjoyable the task, more likely it is for it to be left until the last minute)
- number of tasks that need to be done prior to the task in question (more tasks, more likely to leave until the last minute)
- level of worry/anxiety over meeting the deadline (higher worry meaning greater likelihood of starting early. Distinguished from a sense of 'too anxious to start' which is captured in the first predictor).

The model would then be:

    log-odds('Done last minute') ~ enjoyable_task + n_other_tasks + deadline_worry  

If we assume that most people have some other tasks going on at any one time, have to do mostly unenjoyable tasks whose deadlines are not that important, this model would predict that people often leave things until the last minute.

**c) Induce an alternative model that also has the original observation as a consequence.**

An alternative model that would also be interesting to look at would be at the level of the person, that is asking if someone is a person who generally leaves things until the last minute ('Procrastinator'), or someone who does not (Non-procrastinator). Factors that would determine the probability of 'Procrastinator' might be
- level of overall anxiety (maybe as a square term, with 0 being medium anxiety, because individuals at the both end of the spectrum—very high and very low in anxiety—might be more likely to leave things until the last minute)
- level of perfectionism (the higher the perfectionism, the lower the likelihood of leaving it until the last moment)
- perceived ability to work quickly (people who believe they can get things done quickly, or underestimate the amount of time needed, would be more likely to procrastinate)

The model would then be:

    log-odds('Procrasinator') ~ anxiety^2 - perfectionism + work_quickly   

If we assume that many people are moderately anxious, believe that they can do things quickly and aren't perfectionist, this model would predict that people often leave things until the last minute. Of course, this prediction would change based on the context, e.g. at the UofC, we should probably assume high anxiety and high perfectionism.

**d) For each of the two general models produced in (b) and (c), derive two interesting predictions (four predictions in total). Be sure the logical connection between your model and your predictions is explicitly stated and that any assumed facts concerning the world are made explicit.**

Following the first model, one prediction would be that if a person is faced with a task that they really do not want to do, they might still start early if they have no other tasks that need to be done and/or they worry significantly about the deadline. This would be great, in theory. But, unfortunately, in procrastination one can often come up with new more enjoyable things to be done, which can also relieve the deadline anxiety. A second prediction would be that if there is a large enough number of things that have an earlier deadline, it would be extremely unlikely that a person will do a task early. There seems to be something to this, unless there is a great relative difference in enjoyability of a task (e.g. one might want to write code for a homework due in a week, but not grade homework due tomorrow).

Thinking about the second model, it might predict that even anxious perfectionists might procrastinate, if they have strong enough beliefs in their ability to work quickly. I think this captures many UofC students, whom I probably had in mind as I developed this model. And if we overall assume high perfectionism and high anxiety in the UofC population, the model would predict that whether a UofC student is or is not a procrastinator depends on their perceived ability to work quickly. A second prediction we could make from the model is that very low-anxiety low-perfectionism individuals might always leave things until the last moment, even if they think it will take them a long time to do a task. This might be an accurate prediction as well, as some people maybe just don't care.
